## Week 1: Basic Programs

1. Compile the following C assignment statements into ARM.
  * A=B+C;
  *  DA-C;
  * Perform D = A C using RSB instruction.

2. Convert the following assignment into ARM.
F = (G + H) - (I + J).
Use the register R0 to R4 as operands F to J respectively.

3. Convert statement into ARM where the operand is in memory: G = H + A[10]
